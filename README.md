# maze95-js
This is a reimagined version of the classic Windows 95 3D Maze screensaver originally made in OpenGL. I am rewriting it in three.js as a learning experience for JavaScript and out of boredom.

# What has been implemented
Prototype level to test model loading and level data parameters.
Moving fully implemented except for collision.
No main objective for the game, just walk around and clip through walls.

# Bugs
As stated above, there is no collision, not sure if this really counts as a bug.
