# maze95-js
This is a port / authentic remake of the non interactive classic Windows 95 3D Maze screensaver originally implemented in OpenGL made into an interactive web game experience. I am recreating it with my own little JS game engine called MazeSrc, built on top of Three.js.

# What is implemented?
Randomly generated mazes with fully implemented collision and player movement.

# Why JavaScript?
I think JavaScript is an excellent language. due to it being high level, in certain situations it can be slow however when put into correct use it can make an amazing language.
Making a web game is another part of it, something everybody can play, I doubt this will ever get much attention but it's still fun to work on.

# Why make this project at all?
This project was mainly started a learning experience for JavaScript and Three.js, I began working on it at a point where my JavaScript skills were still flourishing.
Now I have become a skilled JavaScript programmer, I have been learning the language for about 1 year now and I know how to create a lot of things with it.

# Bugs
Sometimes you may spawn out of the map due to how spawn placement works,
Start logo missing due to collision offset bugs,
Smiley face missing due to unfinished level loading and ending code + not being sure how random placement would work in the maze.
