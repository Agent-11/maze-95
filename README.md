# maze95-js
This is a port / remake of the non interactive classic Windows 95 3D Maze screensaver originally implemented in OpenGL. I am rewriting it with three.js as a playable game which sets it apart from other recreations, I am planning to add a classic game mode where it is like the original and a modified custom mode that includes story elements, new characters and effects.

# What is in
Maze map that is near identical to the original generation of the maze, I have found a maze generator addon for Blender that significantly makes my life easier, movement is fully implemented with an unused player with working collision however it is quite difficult to setup especially with collision boxes.

# Bugs
None, other than unfinished collision of course.
