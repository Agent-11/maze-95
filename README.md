# maze95-js
This is a reimagined version of the non interactive classic Windows 95 3D Maze screensaver originally made in OpenGL. I am rewriting it in three.js as a playable game which sets it apart, I am planning to add a classic mode where it is like the original and a modified custom mode that includes story elements, new characters and effects.

# What is in
Maze map that is near identical to the original maze, I have found a maze generator addon for Blender that significantly makes my life easier, movement is fully implemented with an unused player with working collision however it is quite difficult to setup especially with collision boxes, you can press [L] on your keyboard to log your position and Y rotation in the console.

# Bugs
TODO: Stop player until walls rise animation is finished and collision of course
